== cb-rally-connect

Simple solution to update RallyDev objects (mainly user stories and defects)
based on commit messages from CodebaseHQ Git/Mercurial repos.

CodebaseHQ doesn't permit to configure post-receive hooks, but they have a neat
notification system, which supports sending JSON documents via HTTP POST to some 
specific URL (supports basic authn).

cb-rally-connect is a basic rails app that parses the given JSON and updates
rally objects via rally_rest_api. Steps to use cb-rally-connect:

1. Deploy cb-rally-connect to some app server. (I use my dreamhost account or
heroku)

2. Configure all required notifications in CodebaseHQ. Set the URL according to
where you deployed your app. Use your Rally user and password to authenticate to
cb-rally-connect

(http://docs.atechmedia.com/codebase/user-manual/advanced/notification-centre)

3. Include the tokens in your commit messages according to the guidelines below.
Have fun :-)

then marks USXXX as completed

[fixed:DEXXX]
Adds a note to DEXXX referencing the commit, marks all tasks as completed and
then marks DEXXX as fixed

Known issues
------------

- We only support updating stories and defects, inside the user's default
  workspace. (I didn't need those features, that's why I didn't care developing
  them... feel free to send me patches, though)
