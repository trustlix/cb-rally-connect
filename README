== cb-rally-connect

Simple solution to update RallyDev objects (mainly user stories and defects)
based on commit messages from CodebaseHQ Git/Mercurial repos.

CodebaseHQ doesn't permit to configure post-receive hooks, but they have a neat
notification system, which supports sending JSON documents via HTTP POST to some 
specific URL (supports basic authn).

cb-rally-connect is a basic rails app that parses the given JSON and updates
rally objects via rally_rest_api. Steps to use cb-rally-connect:

1. Deploy cb-rally-connect to some app server. (I use my dreamhost account or
heroku)

2. Make sure you configure the environment variables RALLY_PASSWORD and
RALLY_USERNAME, or configure the config/config.yml file.

3. Configure all required notifications in CodebaseHQ. Set the URL according to
where you deployed your app.

4. Include the tokens in your commit messages according to the guidelines below.
Have fun :-)


Stories:
--------

[USXXX]
Adds a conversation post containing the commit's message. Also creates a
changeset (with all changed files). Links everything to the given story

[Completed:USXXX]
Same as above, but also changes the schedule state of USXXX to the one given
before the colon. All available schedule_states are supported.

Example:

$git commit -m "[Completed:USYYY][US10] Your message here"


Defects:
--------

[DEXXX]
Adds a conversation post containing the commit's message. Also creates a
changeset (with all changed files). Link everything to the given Defect

[Fixed:DEXXX]
Same as above, but also changes the state of DEXXX to the one given
before the colon. All available defect states are supported.

Known issues
------------

- We only support updating stories and defects, inside the user's default
  workspace. (I didn't need those features, that's why I didn't care developing
  them... feel free to send me patches, though)
